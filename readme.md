# Work from Cafe

Assignment from [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://ppb.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) (day 88)

*On day 66, we create an API that serves data on cafes with wifi and good coffee. Today, you're going to use the data from that project to build a fully-fledged website to display the information.*<br>
***Included in this assignment is an SQLite database called cafes.db that lists all the cafe data.***<br>
*Using this database and what you learnt about REST APIs and web development, create a website that uses this data. It should display the cafes, but it could also allow people to add new cafes or delete cafes.*
